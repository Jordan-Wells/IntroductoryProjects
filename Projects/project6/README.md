# Project Description
For this project, we were assigned to recreate the board game Othello in terminal. This project was broken into three separate assignments, hence why there are parts A , B, and C. Each folder represents a snapshot of the minimal functionality that was required at the end of each project. If one wishes to only see only the finished project, they would view folder C. To see which features were implemented at each point, one would read the outline given by the professor, available in the README of each folder.
